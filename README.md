# Demo Check-In #1

The first check-in focused on ensuring that the project was started within the first week. For this milestone, I prioritized verifying that the LCD screen was fully functional.

Most of the effort was dedicated to testing the LCD and confirming that it was able to properly draw shapes as simple as a colored rectangle, which was successfully done by the submission deadline.
