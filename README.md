# Wordle Embedded Final Project

This repository contains all submissions for my embedded systems final project. The project is split into **Demo Check-In #1**, **Demo Check-In #2**, and the **Final Submission**. (found in the respective branches)

The overall design consists of **six physical buttons** that the player uses to build and submit words. As well as an **ST7735 128x128 LCD screen** to display all of the game info. 

The gameplay loop replicates the original Wordle game as closely as possible. The ultimate goal of this project was to create a **fully hardware-based version of Wordle**.
